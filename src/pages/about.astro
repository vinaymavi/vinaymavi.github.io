    <h1>Technology Leader | Automation Expert | AI Engineer</h1>
    <p>
      With over 13 years of experience, I have successfully delivered critical
      products leveraging cutting-edge technologies across diverse regions,
      including <b>Canada, the Middle East, and the Americas</b>. I have
      navigated transformative shifts in technology, including the rise of the
      World Wide Web, personal computing, smartphones, and artificial
      intelligence. Each evolution has presented unique challenges and
      opportunities, driving my commitment to delivering exceptional value to
      clients and organizations. <i
        >These experiences have consistently enhanced my expertise, enabling me
        to become a more effective and innovative professional.</i

    <h1>Embracing the Era of Agentic Workflows</h1>
    <p>
      I am deeply convinced that now is the pivotal moment to integrate agentic
      workflows into our processes, as this approach fundamentally reshapes how
      we work. The agentic mindset is transformative, offering immense potential
      to streamline operations and unlock new possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the ideal time for visionary leaders, architects, and innovators
      to fully explore the breadth of their expertise. By adopting an agentic
      approach, we can significantly reduce dependencies on unpredictable
      variables, creating more efficient and resilient systems. <b
        >I am passionately exploring and developing agentic workflows to embed
        AI across the entire development lifecycle—from planning and development
        to testing and production—driving innovation and excellence at every
        stage.</b

    <h1>Trust The Process | Turst The Person | Track the work</h1>
    <p>
      As a dedicated leader, I firmly believe that leadership is a cornerstone
      of any successful organization. I adopt an empathetic leadership approach,
      fostering an environment where trust and collaboration thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      This creates a <i>supportive mental space for my team</i>, enabling them
      to excel throughout the entire project lifecycle. By prioritizing trust
      and open communication, I empower my team to perform at their best and
      contribute meaningfully to our shared goals. This leadership style not
      only drives project success but also cultivates strong professional
      relationships and a positive work culture, fostering camaraderie and
      allowing team members to build lasting connections and find fulfillment in
      their collective achievements.

      software transformation, and shaping the future of work.
